        <!-- Good Website Evaluation 1-->
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://unseen.co/">Good Website Example (name: unseen.co)</a></h3>
            <p>I found this website in a competition for best websites, aparently it was a winner for a 2023 design competition. First thought: its incredible, didn't know this was possible</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Colors on the page are all distinct and contrast well. Looks very nice easy to understand. The best way to describe this is beautiful</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Layout of the page is consistent with all buttons being around the borders. They are also separated on category, (ex: top right is info)</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>All things border-edge aligned. Things that aren't near the border in a neat fashion are dead center to capture users attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>All content that relates to each other are grouped together in the border edges, center content is realted and makes sense. Very pretty page.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Final Remarks: </strong>This page is insanely beautiful, the cursor influence the page while not being too distracting. All content and colors are beautiful as well.
            This makes sense on how it won a contest.</p>

        <!-- Bad Website Evaluation 2-->
        <section>
        <h3><a href="https://thebiguglywebsite.com/">Bad Website (name: the big ugly website)</a></h3>
        <p>This page is unbelievably ugly. It was definitely made ugly on purpose as an example on a really bad crappy webpage. They did a good job on what a website should never look like.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Yellow bright blinding background, black highlighted text, ugly colors everywhere. Also a bright purpose in display. It honestly hurts to look at with max brightness on.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>There is some repition with headers being present, but they're all unaligned, random colors, doesn't make sense, incredibly unstructured as well. No good repitition</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Literally nothing is aligned. Random alignment and things everywhere, photos that aren't loading. Random color boxes in unaligned places. Terrible everything</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Everything is way too cluttered! Two main columns that have content are too close together on the page. All content is not in any neat fashion. Super ugly</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Final Remarks: </strong>This was definitely made to be ugly on purpose. Hard to look at, terrible in very crap category. Good example of what not to do for a webpage in any regard.</p>
