        <p>Hello! I am Kamber Lovill, a Ph.D. student in Evolutionary Biology at the Univeristy of Arkansas in Fayetteville.
            My current focus is on diamtom genetics and their applications in environmental monitoring and assessment. I also 
            frequently use computational methods to analyze large genomic datasets by extracting diamtom DNA sequences from
            metagenomic data. My broader research interests include microbial ecology, bioinformatics, and environmental genomics.

            My overall goal with this research is to develop ways to stop harmful algal blooms from forming in freshwater and saltwater
            systems, as well as to better understand how microbial communities respond to environmental changes such as pollution.
        </p>

        <p>Before going to graduate school, I completed by B.S. in Marine Science: Biological Oceanogrphy at NC State (2025) with a 4.0 GPA.
            During my time there, I found a love for research as I worked in many undergraduate research labs, completed an REU at the Univeristy of
            Washington at Seattle, and worked in animal husbandry at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh, NC. 
        </p>

        <p>In my free time, you can often find me crocheting cute animals, talking to my loved ones, exploring new places, and watching my favorite shows 
            on Netflix.
        </p>
