        Video games has always been a way to connect with others online while having fun. I think thats the beauty in it for me.
        Not only is it a way to connect with people, but it was unique because it allowed me to play with my friends and explore all 
        genres of games. Theres literally something for everyone. Personally, I enjoyed playing games where I'd explore new worlds, 
        complete challenges, and compete with other players to be the best. These generes typically included role playing games and 
        first person shooters. So, think of games like Skyrim, Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty, Halo, Valorant, and League of Legends.
        While I don't play all of these games anymore, the ones listed definitley took a lot of my time growing up. 
      </p>

      <h3>Video game list!</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Halo Series - A first person shooter set in a sci-fi universe where you play as a super soldier fighting against aliens who want to take over the universe.</li>
        <li>Call of Duty Series - A first person shooter series that focuses on modern and historical warfare with both single-player and multiplayer modes (and sometimes zombies).</li>
        <li>Grand Theft Auto Series - An open-world action-adventure game where players can explore cities, complete missions, and engage in various activities (pretty violent).</li>
        <li>Skyrim - An open world role playing game set in a fantasy universe where players can explore, complete quests, and develop their character. (always fun no matter what).</li>
        <li>League of Legends - A multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game where players control champions and compete in team based matches (super team based).</li>
        <li>Valorant - A tactical first person shooter that combines precise gunplay with unique character abilities in team based gameplay (think of Counter-Strike but you have special abilities).</li>
        <li>Minecraft - Open-ended sandbox game that’s great for relaxing builds with friends.</li>
      </ul>

        My name is Brian Mellinger, I am a computer science student with a concentration in cybersecurity at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
        I am a transfer student and I previously attended North Carolina State University but moved to Charlotte to focus on the cybersecurity program here.
        Though, this is my first semester at UNCC, I am excited to see what the Unversity has to offer me. Outside of school, I enjoy eating new foods, exploring 
        new places, hanging out with my friends, experiencing new things, and playing video games. While these are all hobbies of mine, video games is one that is 
        easy to talk about about and easy to do since I can do it at anytime and anywhere unlike my other hobbies. I am excited to share more about this hobby with you!
      </p>

      <h3>Here is a timeline of my story before I got to UNCC</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Played my first video game: Halo (yes, the first one) on xbox</li>
        <li>Went to elementary school in rural North Carolina</li>
        <li>Played a lot of Call of Duty: Modern Warefare</li>
        <li>Started middle school, played a lot of Grand Theft Auto 4</li>
        <li>Started high school, played a lot of League of Legends and Valorant</li>
        <li>Started College in 2023 at NCSU, rarely played video games</li>
        <li>Transferred to UNCC in 2025, still rarely plays video games but that's okay!</li>

    <!-- When section -->

      <h2 id="when-title">When would I play these games?</h2>

        <figcaption><em>Image of me playing video games, courtesy of chatgpt!</em></figcaption>
      </figure>
    <p><em>Prompt used for above: “Make me an image that shows me playing my different video games at my desk!”</em></p>

      <p>
        Lets first focus on the games I mentioned above. The Halo series was one of the first games I played growing up and I think that's where it started.
        It combined first person shooting with a great storyline where I could explore and be the hero. I then moved into games like Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, 
        and Skyrim as I got older. These games were often more complex, you could explore more, and were generally closer to reality. Throughout middle and high school, 
        I would play a lot of League of Legends and Valorant with my friends online. These were highly competitive games that focused on teamwork and strategy. 
        I don't play any of these games anymore, but they were a big part of my life growing up and am looking forward to see if these games make a come back with new releases 
        in the future. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The best times to play video depends on when I was growing up. From elementary school to middle school, the best time was practically anytime I wanted, and that meant I would play non-stop.
        As long as I didn't have homework, wasn't in school, didn't have a club meeting, or had something else to do ... I was probably playing Call of Duty of League of Legends during this time. 
        When I was in highschool, I unfortunately played less and less due to the rigors of my schoolwork and community college. So I often played on the weekdays when I didn't have schoolwork, or on the 
        weekends when I wasn't busy. Summer was typically the best time for me as a teenager because if I wasn't on vacation with my parents, or hanging out with my friends. Summer meant that when I was done 
        working at my restaruant job, I could play video games until I was bored. Now that highschool is over, college is so demanding I rarely ever play, even in the summertime.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now what video games do I play now? Honestly, that's a harder question to answer since I don't play nearly as much. I think recently I've played squad (a shooter based computer game), and minecraft with friends.
        These games are fun because they allow me to connect with my friends and that's typically what draws me to games the most now. 
      </p>

      <h3>List of when I'd play video games</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Elementary School: Anytime I wanted, played non-stop except when my parents would ground me ... haha</li>
        <li>Middle School: After school and on weekends, school was super easy. As long as I didn't get grounded, I'd be okay.</li>
        <li>High School: Weekends and summers, less during school year, school started becoming busy. I also worked and did school clubs.</li>
        <li>College: Rarely play, occasional gaming with friends. I'm super focused on my studies now, but get to play a couple times a month maybe.</li>
        <li>After Graduation: Hoping to carve out more time on weekends and during holidays.</li>
      </ul>

        Like the previous section, this also kind of depends when in time. When I was between 5 - 18 years old, The only place I would really play video games would be at my parents house.
        Ocassionally, I would hang out with my friends at their houses and do whatever, but sometimes I would also play video games at their houses with them. With a hobby like video games, 
        the only place you really play is at home since you need a console or a computer. So, for the most play, I just played in my room at my parents house ... I know, not very exciting. 
        Now that I'm 22, for the past 4 years, I usually play at in my room at my apartment in college. Again, not very exciting, but my console and computer don't get very much use due to schoolwork. 
        Maybe once I graduate and have a job, I'll have more time to play video games at home. I think one day, it'll be cool to have a game/movie room where my partner and I can enjoy ourselves on the weekends 
        and after work. 
      </p>

      <h3>Major gaming areas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Parents House: My room, sometimes friends' houses</li>
        <li>College Apartment: My room, sometimes friends' houses</li>
        <li>Future Home: Game and Movie room</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When I was younger, I always had to rely on my parents' money to play video games. This generally would mean begging for a gaming console for Christmas and games for my birthday. I remember my first gaming 
        console was the first xbox! I then eventually got a Wii, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Playstation 4, Computer, and now a Playstation 5. I still have the gaming computer and the PS5 and use them ocassionally. 
        I ended getting all of these consoles for free from my parents, but the Computer and PS5 I bought with my own money that I earned while working part time at a restuarant job in highschool. The games themselves 
        would also be from my parents' money until I eventually started buying my own games with my own money as I got older. Now, I typically play games on my computer since it's more versatile and I can also do schoolwork.
        Playing these games would typically involve using a controller or a keyboard and mouse depending on the game and what system I was using. Some games were difficult ot play and required a lot of timing and coordination, 
        and some were super easy and required no skill at all. 
      </p>

      <h3>Gaming Consoles I have used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Xbox - First gaming console I ever had, I don't remember how we got it</li>
        <li>Wii - Fun console with motion controls, got it for Christmas (I'm a wii sports legend)</li>
        <li>Playstation 3 - Great console with lots of games, got it for Christmas</li>
        <li>Xbox 360 - Another great console with lots of games, it was my brothers but we shared</li>
        <li>Playstation 4 - Awesome console with even more games, got it for Christmas</li>
        <li>Gaming Computer - Bought with my own money from working part time job in highschool</li>
        <li>Playstation 5 - Latest console with an awesome controller, bought with my own money</li>

        There are so many more reasons that I play video games other than the ones that I mentioned in the first paragraph. Video games aren't only something for fun, but they're were something to keep me busy. 
        They were a way for me to kill time, escape reality, challenge myself, and find something to do when I was bored. Being able to just keep my mind busy was a big reason why. No matter what emotion I was going through, 
        video games were always there to help me get through it. Whether I was bored and needed something to do, sad and going through a breakup, or just needed to escape from reality for a little while, I always knew I could count on 
        my video games to be there for me. 
      </p>
      <p>
        They are a part of my life and always will be, even if I rarely play anymore. In the future, I hope to explore different games, play with my friends like old times, and even explore virtual reality gaming. I think that is a super 
        exciting and cool piece of technology that has so much potential. Overall, video games have been a great hobby of mine and I look forward to see what the future holds for gaming!
      </p>

      <h3>Reasons why I play video games</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fun and Entertainment</li>
        <li>Social Connection with Friends</li>
        <li>Challenge and Skill Development</li>
